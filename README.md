# COVID-MOBILITY-IMPACT

My professors at New York Tech & NJIT and I created a framework to measure the impact that events have had on COVID-19 cases and subway usage in New York City using data posted on the CDC and the MTA websites. We use a combination of change point detection and nueral networks to generate the impact. Change point detection tells us when there was a significant change in the data and the Nueral Network was trained to predict what both COVID-19 cases and subway usage numbers would have been like 7 days ahead had nothing changed.

This is the code for the website that will be hosted soon. 

It was made using Dash, a Plotly extension that is built on Flask. It is a very useful tool to make interactive dashboards.
